# TicTacToe

Reflection: Fairly straightforward probject. I learned a bit about using dialog modals and 
data attributes. 
I was able to keep everything except for 1 variable out of global scope. 



Problem to solve: If I define counter inside gameBoard and pass counter to each tile using addEventListener, each tile will have their own counter of 0 instead of editing the counter made in gameBoard(). How can I fix this without a global variable?
