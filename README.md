# TicTacToe



TDL:    Gameboard object, turn determine object



012  = 3
345  = 12
678  = 21

036  = 9
147  = 12
258  = 15

048  = 12
246  = 12




Problem to solve: If I define counter inside gameBoard and pass counter to each tile using addEventListener, each tile will have their own counter of 0 instead of editing the counter made in gameBoard(). How can I fix this without a global variable?
